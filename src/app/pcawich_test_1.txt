1.) Which of the queries below would allow me to calculate the average salary of all
current employees per department and to display department names and salary averages
in descending order of the average salary?

==================================================
B

SELECT D.dept_name, AVG(S.salary) AS avgs
FROM employees AS E
JOIN salaries AS S
ON E.emp_no = S.emp_no
JOIN dept_emp AS DE
ON DE.emp_no = S.emp_no
JOIN departments AS D
ON D.dept_no = DE.dept_no
WHERE S.to_date > NOW()
AND DE.to_date > NOW()
GROUP BY D.dept_name
ORDER BY avgs DESC

==================================================
------------------------------------------------
2.) Write a query that returns the correct count of employees in the database whose first name 
starts with the letter B. I have gone ahead and written the first line for you.


==================================================
SELECT COUNT(first_name)
FROM employees
WHERE first_name LIKE 'B%';
==================================================
------------------------------------------------
3.) Complete the missing parts of the query below. This query when complete, will return a list 
of the first 10 employees (first names and last names) that the company hired. The result should
be ordered alphabetically (A-Z) by the employee last name.


==================================================
SELECT *
FROM (
		SELECT E.first_name, E.last_name
		FROM E AS E
		ORDER BY E.hire_date, E.last_name ASC
		LIMIT 10
	) AS res
ORDER BY 2 ASC;

==================================================

-------------------------------------------------
4.) Explain what the query below does / returns.

SELECT DP.dept_no AS deptnumber, DP.dept_name AS deptname, AVG(salary) AS 
avg_salary
FROM salaries AS S
JOIN dept_emp AS DE
ON DE.emp_no = S.emp_no
JOIN departments AS DP
ON DE.dept_no = DP.dept_no
WHERE DATE_PART(‘year’, S.from_date) = 1988
GROUP BY DP.dept_no

==================================================
Answer:

This query returns the department number, department name and the average salaries of the departments employeees whose salaries began in 1988.
